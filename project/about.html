	<!-- first Q -->
	<div class="div1">What is a corona virus?</div>
	<p class="p1">
	   Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans<br>.   In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the <br>common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe<br>Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus<br>disease COVID-19.<br>
	</p>

	<!-- second Q -->
	<div class="div2">What is COVID-19?</div>
	<p class=p2>
	  COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new <br> virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December<br> 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.<br>
	</p>

	<!-- third Q -->
	<div class="div3">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</div>
	<p class="p3">
	        1-Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.<br>
			2-When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others.<br> This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or <br>.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may  <br> be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are <br>in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.
	</p>

	<!-- forth Q -->
	<div class="div4">If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the  following:</div>
	<p class="p4">
	        1-If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate.<br>

			2-Even if you donâ€™t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms,<br> then self-isolate and monitor yourself.<br>

			3-You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease when you<br> just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.<br>

			4-If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person,<br> self-quarantine for 14 days.
	</p>

	<!-- fifth Q -->
	<div class="div5">How can I protect myself from the coronavirus disease?</div>
	<p class="p5">
	        1-Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.<br>
			2-Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.<br>
			3-Avoid touching your face.<br>
			4-Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.<br>
			5-Stay home if you feel unwell.<br>
